                        The first supernatural Ghost Rider is stunt motorcyclist
                        Johnny Blaze, who, in order to save the life of his
                        father, agreed to give his soul to "Satan" (later
                        revealed to be an arch-demon named Mephisto). At night
                        and when around evil, Blaze finds his flesh consumed by
                        hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull. He
                        rides a fiery motorcycle and wields blasts of hellfire
                        from his body, usually from his skeletal hands.

                        The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a
                        skeletal superhuman wreathed in ethereal flame and given
                        supernatural powers. He can explode his bike. The
                        abnormal motorcycle he rides can travel faster than any
                        conventional vehicle and can perform seemingly
                        impossible feats such as riding up a vertical surface,
                        across water, and leaping across great distances that
                        normal motorcycles cannot. The Ghost Riders are
                        virtually indestructible and notoriously hard to injure
                        by any conventional means, as bullets and knives usually
                        pass through them without causing pain (knives are shown
                        to melt while in their body). It is possible that they
                        are genuinely immortal, as it is said that God created
                        them and only God can destroy them. Despite being
                        composed of bone and hellfire, the Ghost Riders possess
                        formidable superhuman strength, enough to easily pick up
                        a truck and hurl it across a road. It has been stated
                        that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can press around 25
                        tons (50,000 lbs) (or more as seen in World War Hulk).
                        Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to
                        him or her.
